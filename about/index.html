            <h3>Origination</h3>
            <p>One day, a server was created. It was called PokeWorld, and 3 people decided to join in on the project; making a Discord bot for the server. These 3 people were jtsshieh, Alee, and TheEdge. This went on, until jtsshieh, and TheEdge decided to leave that server. Then, a few hours later, this PokeWorld you are reading about now was created.</p>
