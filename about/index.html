            <h2>Learn about us.</h2>
            <h3>Origination</h3>
            <p>One day, a server was created. It was called PokeWorld, and 3 people decided to join in on the project; making a Discord bot for the server. These 3 people were jtsshieh, Alee, and TheEdge. This went on, until jtsshieh, and TheEdge decided to leave that server. Then, a few hours later, this PokeWorld you are reading about now was created.</p>
            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>We are currently working on a few projects. These include: PokeBot, Typer, and this website.</p>
            <h4><a href="../pokebot" style="color:white">PokeBot</a></h4>
            <p>The project that inspired us to keep on going. This is the Discord bot that powers our server; from moderation, to fun commands.</p>
            <h4><a href="../typer" style="color:white">Typer</a></h4>
            <p>The program that presses the keys for you.</p>
            <h4>Website</h4>
            <p>Well, you are here now. The website is our portal to everything related to PokeWorld!</p>
            <p>And the website design was made by Alee (Owner of AleeCorp Network)</p>
