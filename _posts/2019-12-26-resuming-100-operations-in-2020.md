title: Resuming 100% operations in 2020.
---
***Aloha!***

It is with great enthusiasm that I announce PokeWorld will be resuming 100% operations within the first quarter 2020, and that means the bot will finally be receiving semi-regular updates.

**Things we want to bring out to you ASAP.**

* Gyms in all servers
* Generic team roles in all servers

**Things we want to bring out by the end of the first half of the year.**

* Gyms with customization
* Teams with customization
* "Guilds"

  * Replacement for the current team system
  * Guilds can be created by users
  * Maximum of 6 people per guild.

**Some sneak peeks of what we have planned for the near future and beyond!**

* Sleek moderation customization
* Sexy guild UI in Discord
* Dynamic change-log on our website, displaying detailed info from GitHub.
* Cross-server trading boards (the server owner can opt into this option using a command)
* Web Dashboard?

  * Manage your server and the settings pertaining to it
  * Create custom icons for gyms that might be used in companion applications, along with managing other aspects of the gyms (legacy team system, max amount of claims per user, etc.)
  * See all of the guild cards and info in your server
  * Online mod-logs linked in your server's dashboard.
  * Configuration for the bot removed from commands

Thank you all for sticking with the bot despite a long amount of inactivity. We are glad to be back, and we hope we can bring our creation out to more people

Merry Christmas, and happy new year!
